# ShipCompliantBrewBuilder
Brew Builder excersice/homework for ShipCompliant

Technical Assignment:
For this exercise, assume that you will be working with another
 developer.  One of you will be focusing on the front-end, the other one will be doing the server side.  You get to pick which side of the app you will be working on, but be ready to explain what you would expect your teammate to implement.  

Create a simple single page application that allows users to
 design beer recipes. The user requires the following features:
 Ability to Search Ingredients (e.g. hops, grain, extract)
Ability to Save a Recipe
Ability to search for a recipe

The maintainability and testability of your code will be considered,
 and remember that UX and UI count too!

While this is purely a demonstration exercise (i.e. we do not
 intend to use your code in any way), your solution should be well organized and runnable. Delivering a github repo with the solution is good enough for us. You may have an opportunity to present your work to our VP of Product Development and our Director of
 Engineering, so be sure that you can demo your application, discuss decisions you made, what you learned, what you might do differently, and identify anything you would do given more time.

For extra credit points - implement your teammateâ€™s code for
 an end-to-end functional prototype.
